BUILDING INDEX:
In order to build the inverted index for our corpus you will need to run this following command:
```
python main.py build
```
This will take a decent amount of time to run.


SEARCHING IN CONSOLE:
To search after you built the inverted index use this following command:
```
python main.py search ""
```
Then you type in the query that you want after the Search text and press enter, (e.g query = machine learning) the console will look like this:
```
Search machine learning
```
Upon pressing enter the console will display the top 5 urls from the query


SEARCHING IN GUI:
To search after you built the inverted index on a GUI use this following command:
```
python searchPage.py
```
after doing this you should click on the localhost and there will a simple search interface
